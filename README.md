# advent-of-code-custom-customs-challenge

this is a challenge from Advent of Code. I solved this challenge both in SQL and Python. I am only sharing my Python script. Please let me know your feedback. 

this is not very efficient way to solve this problem.  I could have done a better job using hashtables if I spent more time on it. 

here is a link to the full problem description.
